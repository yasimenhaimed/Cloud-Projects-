# FIRST PROJECT WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION

## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LAMP STACK) IN AWS
A technology stack refers to a carefully selected combination of frameworks, programming languages, databases, and other tools used to build a software product. These components are chosen to work seamlessly together, creating a cohesive and efficient system.
For instance, the LAMP stack, a stalwart of web development, encompasses:
- Linux: The operating system
- Apache: The web server
- MySQL: The database management system
- PHP: The programming language

Each element in the LAMP stack fulfills a distinct role and synergizes with the others to furnish dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.


After logging into AWS, you'll see the main console, where you can find all the available services listed for you to navigate through.

Before creating an EC2 instance, choose the region closest to you. Consider factors like speed, security, and cost when making your decision.
